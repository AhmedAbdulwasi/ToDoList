# Simple To-Do List Website
You got a lot of tasks to remember, don't you? Why not write them in this simple Python program that allows you to create, show, delete, load, and save tasks through your inputs?

**FULL-STACK UPDATE:** Simple To-Do List Website that allows you to create, view, delete, or update tasks easily. You are also free to use the old version of the ToDoList in the OLD folder.

## Why?
I started this project a few months ago to dive more into Definition functions in Python, There were a lot of problems and I left it to focus on a new job during the summer and on web development languages. 

This week, I just got back to Python because one of my Computer Science courses used Python and said why not fix and finish this project so I did. Learned file operations, and definition functions.

**FULL-STACK UPDATE:** I realized that I have never done a FULL-STACK project before and I wanted to get a glimpse at what full-stack really is. Flask was one of the frameworks I wanted to learn and expand as well as React.js and so I thought of updating this project as it comes with the main RESTful API methods which are GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. While I've enjoyed React.js and the frontend aspect of it, I came to realize that I like the backend of things. I've found it much funner to create models, API endpoints, and just using python in general rather than creating the frontend of the website using React.js but it was still great nonetheless.

## How To Access The Website
Step 1: Download the zip file and unzip it in a new folder that you created for the zip file.

Step 2: Go To Visual Studio code or a different IDE and open the folder that you created that contains the unzipped files/folders such as frontend, backend, requirements, etc.

Step 3: Open two different terminals, the first one is for backend and the second one will be for frontend.

Step 4: For the backend, "source backend/Scripts/activate" for the bash terminal (which I use) to activate the virtual environment then type "pip install -r requirements.txt" and the "cd backend".

Step 5: In the terminal for backend, type "export FLASK_APP=myapp.py", then "export FLASK_ENV=development", and then "flask run"

Step 6: Now for the frontend, type "cd frontend", and then "npm run dev"

Step 7: Click on the localhost website and there you have it, there should be the ToDoList website working.

Step 8: If you experienced any issues, you might need to download node, python, or bash, etc.
