## Why?
I started this project a few months ago to dive more into Definition functions in Python, There were a lot of problems and I left it to focus on a new job during the summer and on web development languages. 

This week, I just got back to Python because one of my Computer Science courses used Python and said why not fix and finish this project so I did. Learned file operations, and definition functions.
